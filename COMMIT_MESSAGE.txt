fix: resolve DbUpdateConcurrencyException when adding items to transactions

Root cause: EF Core was generating UPDATE instead of INSERT for new
TransactionItem rows when loading transactions with Include(t => t.Items)
or when modifying tracked entities. This led to "Attempted to update or
delete an entity that does not exist in the store."

Repository changes:
- AddItemToTransactionAsync: use FindAsync (no Include) to load
  transaction; explicitly add new item via _context.TransactionItems.Add()
- UpdateAsync: explicitly add detached items before SaveChanges to avoid
  EF treating them as updates
- GetByIdAsync: include Items for correct TotalAmount and items on read
- PublishDomainEventsAsync: handle null IPublishEndpoint (tests)
- IPublishEndpoint made nullable in repository constructor

Domain/Infrastructure:
- TransactionItem: add TransactionId, update constructor
- Transaction: use new TransactionItem(Id, productId, ...) in AddItem
- DbContext: HasMany/WithOne for Transaction→TransactionItem; ignore Version
- Program: environment-aware DB init (EnsureDeleted only in Development)

Tests:
- Replace MassTransit.Testing with MassTransit.TestFramework
- Add Testcontainers.RabbitMq, fix MessagingFixture API
- RabbitMqBuilder: use constructor with image to fix obsolete warning
- MessagingFixture: nullable _serviceProvider and _harness
- TransactionItemTests: update for new constructor signature
- API tests: fix record constructors, location assertion
- TransactionWorkflowTests: AddMassTransitTestHarness, fix assertions
- Add public partial class Program for WebApplicationFactory
